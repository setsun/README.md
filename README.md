## I am Setsun ðŸŒ‡

I'm an engineer and a creative who is comfortable working across the fullstack, with a focus on the frontend.

I'm interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web: from it's usage as an accessible platform to build/distribute apps, to an expressive medium for art + technology.

In that pursuit, I'm interested in novel applications of WebGL, WebAudio, and WebAssembly. In particular, on how they can help build richer and more performant experiences on the web.
