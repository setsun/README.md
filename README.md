## I am Setsun ðŸŒ‡

I'm an engineer and a creative who is interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web: from it's usage as an accessible platform to build/distribute software, to an expressive medium for art + technology.

In that pursuit, I'm interested in novel applications of WebGPU, WebXR, WebAudio, and WebAssembly. In particular, on how they can help build richer, expressive, and performant experiences on the web.
